# Memristor, Phase Change Memory Simulator
This repository will continue all the codes created for simulating crossbar-arrays.
If you found this code useful for your work, the authors would appreciate your citation of the paper:
Y J Noori, C H de Groot "Modelling Resistive and Phase Change Memory with Passive Selector Arrays - A Matlab Tool" Springer Journal of Computational Electronics (2020) https://doi.org/10.1007/s10825-020-01504-7 . Doing so, will ensure that the authors continue on updating the code and keep it open-source.
